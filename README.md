## 2nd Place Scheme on Action Recognition Track of ECCV 2020 VIPriors Challenges: An Efficient Optical Flow Stream Guided Framework

In this work, we try to propose a data-efficient framework that can train the model from scratch on small datasets while achieving promising results. Specifically, by introducing a 3D central difference convolution operation, we proposed a novel C3D neural network-based two-stream (Rank Pooling RGB and Optical Flow) framework for the task. 

The method is validated on the action recognition track of the ECCV 2020 VIPriors challenges and got the 2nd place (88.31\%).
